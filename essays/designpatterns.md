## We Don't Write Software From Scratch Any Longer

When most people imagine software engineering, they picture someone typing thousands of lines of code into an empty editor. But modern development looks very different. We now build with frameworks, libraries, APIs, and, importantly, design patterns. It’s similar to building a house, you don’t manufacture every brick or window; you assemble proven components into a structure that reliably works. Likewise, software engineering today is about reusing ideas that have already been tested and refined, allowing us to focus on solving new problems without reinventing the wheel.

## So Much More than Writing Code

Writing code is only one small part of our role. What we really do as software engineers is solve problems in ways that are efficient, predictable, and maintainable. Coming up with brand-new solutions every time would be slow and error-prone. Design patterns exist so we can apply well understood structures to recurring problems. They keep systems organized, reduce unnecessary complexity, and give teams a shared language to discuss architecture. Patterns guide us toward stability over improvisation—practical creativity rather than unchecked experimentation.

## Blueprints at Work: How I’ve Used Design Patterns

Throughout ICS 314, I began noticing design patterns everywhere in our work. Even before formally learning about them, we were already using patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) and React container/presentational components to separate data, logic, and UI. These structures made debugging and iteration far easier.

The most hands-on encounter with patterns came from our final project, WarriorHub, built on the Next.js Application Template. The template uses multiple design patterns behind the scenes: separation of concerns in the directory layout, reusable UI components, built-in authentication flows, and clean form handling. Using a framework grounded in strong patterns allowed our team to focus less on setup and more on building features that mattered to users.

## Understanding and Adapting Patterns

Learning design patterns is not about memorizing names, it’s about understanding the reasoning behind them so we know when each one applies. Not every pattern fits every problem, and part of developing skill as an engineer is adapting patterns to the situation at hand. Thinking in patterns encourages us to plan architecture before writing code, leading to cleaner, more maintainable systems.

Patterns also give teams a shared vocabulary, making collaboration smoother and reducing misunderstandings. They let us build more quickly and with greater confidence because we’re drawing on solutions refined by many developers before us.
