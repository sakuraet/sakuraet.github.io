# Third, create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

*You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so.* -Philip K. Dick

This is a quote I often think about when I’m required to take the next step toward my future. Uncertainty is constant, unlike my drive for change— an odd pairing that always leaves me in the perfect place for reflecting on the alternating paths that have led me here. Every decision feels like debugging the code of my own life: sometimes I hit an error, sometimes I optimize a process, and sometimes I discover a path I never expected.

## Debugging the career code 

My interest in software engineering stems from my personal belief that technology and humanity must coexist for the advancement of virtually anything in life. Thus, I believe that software is a tool that transforms abstract concepts into systems people can use in their everyday lives. As a math major, I’m drawn to the elegant side of structure and precision. I spend time working with R to clean messy data, build visualizations, and search for patterns hidden in chaos. I’ve even researched optimal pathing for bus routes, where a small improvement in efficiency can cascade into affecting an entire community’s quality of life. To me, the smallest errors lead to the most unexpected paths.

## Imagining Digital Futures

In the future, I hope to deepen my skills in designing software that balances efficiency, usability, and maintainability. The clean lines of an algorithm remind me of solving mathematical proofs, while system design feels like building a roadmap for others to follow. Therefore, learning more about algorithms, data structures, and system design will help me create software that is not only functional but also optimized for performance. At the same time, I want to sharpen my ability to write readable and collaborative code that other developers can easily understand and build upon.

# Collaborating with fellow andriods 

Another area I want to grow in is teamwork and collaboration. Software engineering is rarely a solo endeavor, it is a field that thrives on communication between developers, designers, and end users. I hope to gain experience with control systems, correct development practices, and collaborative coding platforms so that I can contribute effectively to group projects. Learning to debug not just code, but also misunderstandings and mismatched expectations, is an equally important skill I want to refine.

## Dreaming beyond the loop 

In the end, my goal is to use software engineering as a bridge between abstract ideas and tangible improvements in society. Whether it’s visualizing data in a way that sparks change, optimizing networks like bus systems to better serve communities, or contributing to open-source tools that simplify someone’s day, I want my work to ripple outward in meaningful ways. Thus I look foward to the road ahead as I know every bug fixed, every dataset cleaned, every algorithm refined is a step toward shaping not only my career but the world around me.

And ultimately, here is what I think: no matter what path you choose, no matter what skills or knowledge you gather, you are bound to do “wrong.” 
But wrong is not always the enemy, it can be the beginning of unexpected paths, the gateway to a new design, or even the spark that leads you to the electric sheep you’ve been dreaming about all along. So as I continue to reflect on my technical skills, my math background, and my future in software engineering, I’ll keep dreaming beyond the loop.
