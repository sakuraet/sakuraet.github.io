Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development. Of course, web application development is a skill you’ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:

    Open Source Software Development
    Configuration Management
    Functional Programming
    Development Environments
    Coding Standards
    User Interface Frameworks
    Agile Project Management
    Design Patterns
    Ethics in Software Engineering

For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. You must define these terms if you are using them.

## Discovering the Real World of Software Engineering

Before taking ICS 314, a software engineering course, I did not have a clear understanding of what software engineering actually involved. Like many people, I assumed it was mainly about writing code from scratch and building applications entirely on your own. Early in the course, however, I learned that modern software engineering is far more collaborative, structured, and process-driven than I expected. While I already knew that prewritten code existed in the form of libraries and that import statements allow developers to reuse others’ work, ICS 314 showed me how central reuse, collaboration, and organization are to real-world software development.

Throughout the semester, we built web applications while gradually learning the underlying tools and concepts that support professional development environments. We started with the fundamentals—TypeScript, JavaScript, and HTML—before transitioning into modern frameworks and tools such as Bootstrap, React, and finally Next.js. While learning these technologies was valuable, the most important lesson I gained from this course was how to work effectively in a team-based development environment. Collaborating with others, managing shared codebases, and contributing responsibly to a group project taught me skills that I believe are more important than any single programming language.

## Understanding and Applying Design Patterns

One of the most influential concepts I learned in ICS 314 was the idea of design patterns. A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common software design problem. Rather than reinventing solutions each time, developers can rely on proven patterns to create software that is more maintainable, readable, and scalable.

Although we did not explicitly design our own patterns from scratch, we worked extensively with established patterns through the Next.js GitHub template provided for the course. This template demonstrated effective ways to organize components, handle database interactions, and structure application logic. It served as a practical example of how design patterns function in real projects. Because every student used the same base template, we were able to customize and extend it to create unique applications while still benefiting from a shared, well-designed foundation.

This experience helped me understand the value of reusable structures beyond web development. In a field I am personally interested in, such as game development, similar principles apply. For example, creating reusable base character systems or environment templates would save time and improve consistency across projects. Learning to recognize and apply design patterns has shown me how thoughtful design can significantly improve long-term development efficiency.

## Learning Agile Through Issue-Driven Project Management

Another major concept I learned in ICS 314 was Agile Project Management, specifically Issue-Driven Project Management (IDPM). Agile project management is an approach that emphasizes flexibility, iterative progress, and collaboration. Instead of planning an entire project upfront, Agile methods focus on breaking work into manageable tasks that can be adjusted as the project evolves.

Issue-Driven Project Management is a specific Agile style where all work is organized into “issues.” An issue is a clearly defined task that needs to be completed by a certain deadline. Large goals are broken down into smaller, more specific issues, which are then assigned to individual team members. This ensures accountability and helps prevent confusion or duplicated effort.

In IDPM, issues typically move through three stages: not started, in progress, and finished. Tracking work this way made expectations clear and allowed our team to see progress in real time. Compared to traditional group projects, where responsibilities can be vague and unevenly distributed, IDPM created a more structured and fair workflow. I could easily see myself applying this project management style to non-software projects, such as organizing events or coordinating research tasks, because it promotes transparency and shared responsibility.

## Moving Forward with Confidence

Overall, ICS 314 helped me grow not only as a programmer, but also as a collaborator and problem-solver. I learned that software engineering is not just about writing code, but about designing systems that other people can understand, maintain, and build upon. Concepts such as design patterns and Agile project management have changed how I approach both technical and non-technical projects.

These lessons will stay with me regardless of where my career leads. Whether I continue in software engineering, pursue game development, or work in another collaborative field, the skills I gained in this course—structured thinking, teamwork, and responsible development—will continue to be valuable.
