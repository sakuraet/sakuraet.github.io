## Discovering the Real World of Software Engineering

Before taking ICS 314, I didn't have a clear understanding of what software engineering actually involved. Like many students, I assumed it was primarily about writing code and building applications from scratch. Early in the course, however, I learned that software engineering is far more about collaboration, organization, and long-term maintainability than individual programming ability. While I already knew that libraries and frameworks existed, ICS 314 showed me how essential reuse, shared standards, and structured workflows are in real-world software development.

Throughout the semester, we built web applications while learning the tools and practices that support professional development environments. We began with foundational technologies such as TypeScript, JavaScript, and HTML, and then transitioned into modern frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and Next.js. Although learning these technologies was valuable, the most important lesson I gained from this course was how to work effectively in a team. Managing shared codebases, coordinating work with others, and contributing responsibly to a group project taught me skills that extend far beyond web development.

## Understanding and Applying Design Patterns

One of the most impactful concepts introduced in ICS 314 was design patterns. A design pattern is a reusable solution to a recurring problem in software design. Rather than inventing new structures each time, developers rely on patterns to produce software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

We encountered design patterns primarily through the Next.js GitHub template used throughout the course. While the template itself was not a single design pattern, it demonstrated how well-structured patterns work together in practice. It provided consistent approaches to organizing components, handling data, and structuring application logic. Because every student used the same template, we could focus on extending functionality instead of reinventing core architecture. This experience showed me how powerful good design decisions can be when building software collaboratively.

The value of design patterns extends beyond web development. In areas I am interested in, such as computer graphics, similar principles apply. Reusable hierarchical models, physics components, or environment templates can significantly reduce development time while improving consistency. ICS 314 helped me understand that good software design is about creating systems that scale and adapt over time.

## Learning Agile Through Issue-Driven Project Management

Another major concept I learned in ICS 314 was Agile Project Management, specifically Issue-Driven Project Management (IDPM). Agile project management is an approach that emphasizes adaptability, incremental progress, and continuous feedback. Instead of planning an entire project upfront, work is broken into smaller tasks that can be completed, reviewed, and adjusted as the project evolves.

Issue-Driven Project Management organizes all work into clearly defined “issues,” each representing a specific task, feature, or fix. Issues are assigned to individuals, scoped to be completed within a short time frame, and tracked through states such as not started, in progress, and finished. We managed these issues using GitHub project boards, which allowed everyone on the team to see what needed to be done and who was responsible for each task.

This approach significantly improved accountability and reduced confusion compared to traditional group projects. Working in small branches tied to individual issues and merging frequently helped prevent large merge conflicts and kept the codebase stable. I can easily see myself applying IDPM to other collaborative projects, even outside of software development, because it provides clarity, structure, and momentum.

## Coding Standards and Maintainable Software

Coding standards were another foundational concept reinforced throughout the course. Coding standards are shared rules and conventions that guide how code is written and organized. These standards improve readability, consistency, and maintainability, especially in team environments where many developers contribute to the same codebase.

In ICS 314, we enforced coding standards using ESLint. While the constant linting feedback was sometimes frustrating, it ultimately helped me internalize good coding practices. The linter caught stylistic issues as well as potential bugs, such as unused variables or inconsistent returns. Over time, this made my code cleaner and easier for others to read and review.

I learned that coding standards are not just about formatting, but about reducing errors and supporting collaboration. In larger projects, inconsistent code can quickly lead to confusion and technical debt. Automated tools and shared standards help prevent those issues and allow teams to focus on solving meaningful problems instead of fixing avoidable mistakes.

## Moving Forward with Confidence

By the end of ICS 314, I realized that the course was not truly about web development, but about how software is engineered in real-world environments. Through working in teams, managing evolving codebases, and applying structured development practices, I gained a deeper understanding of what it means to build sustainable software.

Concepts such as design patterns, Agile project management, configuration management, and coding standards have reshaped how I think about programming. These ideas apply across technologies and industries, and they will remain relevant regardless of where my career leads. ICS 314 helped me move beyond writing code that works, toward writing software that is maintainable, collaborative, and responsible.
