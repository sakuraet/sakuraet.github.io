## My Hot Take

Ah yes, coding standards... The bane of many programmers, myself included, as my title clearly shows. While many people argue the benefits of coding standards, hereâ€™s my case: whitespace is an archaic concept that should be left behind.

## Coding Standards

So what are coding standards? 

To me coding standards are just style rules depending on how the developers thought organization would fit best for them. However, the internet says that these minor changes like indentation, brace placement, semicolons, or line length are the key structures to reliable and maintable code. 

Now don't get me wrong, some coding standards like avoiding undeclared variables, unused imports, or confusing scoping rules, are beneficial overall. However, most coding standards, in my opinon take away from the bigger picture when it comes to coding. I think instead of spending time fixing tabs versus spaces or the indentation of a bracket, programmers could spend more time working on their logic and actual debugging.

## Eslint

ESLint is a tool that checks your code against standards like these, and boy was it an interesting experience to say the least. I think after this week I know how Moses felt when he split apart the red sea, immediate red squiggles the moment you run. I do have to admit though after the first few times working with Eslint, the struggle does get easier and the auto fix feature becomes your new favorite buddy. 

However, one has to appreciate the clarity of code Eslint makes you write. Kinda like how one has to imagine Sisyphus is happy cleanning all these errors. But, I digress. Eslint is a good tool to have when working on a project with multiple collaboraters, the squeaky clean code allows for less friction on teams and readability for eveyone. I can imagine that implementing coding standards in large projects, like building packages, would be the best scenario for everyone. Although, I think other tools rather than Eslint are better for beginners like myself, which is why I still believe that coding standards should not hold as much importance as they do.

## A Hill I'm Willing To Die On

So are coding standards and eslint worth the struggle? Personally, no not really, at least not for the small things. Although I agree that you cannot test, review, or reason about code that is inconsistent and messy. Most coding standards these days are just a roadblock to the real coding experience. Now, I still think we should have some format of coding standards so that peace is maintained, but at the end of the day, I think we can afford to loosen up a bit. Especially on whitespace, and that's a hill I'm willing to die on.

Oh! And of course, the grammar checking and editing is courtesy of the one and only ChatGPT!
