“I am ... cogito ergo sum ... I think, therefore I am.”
― Harlan Ellison, I Have No Mouth & I Must Scream 

## Introduction:

To turn a blind eye to the overwhelming prevelance that AI has in not only the classroom but professional enviornments like the computer science field and job market would to be a fool. It's cemented itself as an integral part of optimizng work effciency and even learning that it will not be going anywhere anytime soon. Even I much to my dismay use it nearly everyday for tasks especially in ICS 314 where I personally used ChatGPT and Claude to help me with my coding tasks.

## Personal Experience with AI: 

### Experience WODs

In the beginning I tried to refrain my usage of AI on the experience WODS because although I would save time and AI would be better at creating compact code than I would be. I found that using AI severly depleted the actual knowlegdge I would gain from the class or the experience I would have by rathe doiing it myself. However, ICS314 speficially was an extremely dense class in terms of deliverables and it essentially required students to turn to AI in order to finish their assignments on time, due to the class deliberatly being created with AI in mind.

### In-class Practice WODs

From what I remember I would be fairly lax with my use of AI for the in-class practice WODs because they weren’t graded by accuracy.

### In-class WODs

The way that the in-class WODs were structured required you to use AI or else it would be virtually ipossible to finish the WODs in time. For both the In-class Practice WODs and the In-class WODs, I found that the time frame was too fast to not use AI on the assignments. Since the stakes were so high the pay out of not using AI was severe, it was really like you either use AI or asking losing 90% of your grade on a heavily weighted assigment. Only a fool wouldn't use AI in this case, it was necessary to use AI to complete the tasks unless you were willing to forfeight your grade for understanding the material which is a bet that most would not take.

### Essays

As for writing my essays, I still have not used AI as I think no-one including myself wants to read AI generated writing. Moreover, I do not enjoy the "voice" that AI has and I would rather practice my typing skills than waste a bathtub amount of water. However, I do use AI to check for spellng and grammar errors as I'm pretty prone to those.

### Final project

For the final project, I used Claude to help me generate code given our requirements. I would provide Claude with the requirements and ask it to generate code snippets that I could then integrate into our project. It was mostly "vibe coded" as AI would be able to output a rough draft quicker than I could type through it.

### Learning a Concept / Tutorials 

This is the largest section that I use AI and what I personally believe that AI has a beneficial role in. I find myself asking AI for a high-level overview of a concept, or to provide me with an example so I can think through it myself. For learning new concepts or tutorials, I would often use ChatGPT to explain concepts in simpler terms or provide examples that would help me understand the material better. I found this particularly useful because AI is really stong at simplifying complex ideas and providing simple examples that are easy to understand. 

### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord 

For answering questions in class or discord, I didn't use AI tools. I believe that if you need AI to ask a question or answer a question we might be doomed but a larger factor is that I didn't ask or answer many questions in general.

### Asking or Answering a Smart-Question 

For asking or answering smart questions, I didn't use AI, however I didn't ask a smart-question in general so.

### Coding Example 

This ties in with the ‘Learning a concept / tutorial’ section. I use AI to give me an example to understand use-cases in the earlier WODs however I've never explicitly asked for a coding example.

### Explaining Code

For explaining code, I generally try to parse through the code on my own. My belief is that if I'm using AI to generate code for time and efficeny's sake I should at least understand what the code is doing. The only exception to this was the in-class WODs where the outcome of a passing grade prevailed more than knowledge of the material.

### Writing Code

For writing code, I used Claude to write solutions given a set of requirements. Sometimes I would take the code generated by Claude and run it to see what outputs it produced. Then I would parse through the code line by line to understand what each part of the code did. This was mostly due to time-constraints and

### Documenting Code

As for documenting code, I perfer to do it myself as I find AI lacks the human touch needed for explanation. Often times the LLMs will add unnecessary styling choices to the comments, or the comments itself would be too verbose or lacking.

### Quality Assurance

I often used ChatGPT for this when an error would come up and I had to debug it. A common example would be to fix my ESLint errors or to find a brea in logic for use-cases in the earlier WODs.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding:

The benefits of AI is highly controversial for me, on one end I believe it's a great tool in terms of time-efficency however, the payout is the amount of knowledge gained. It's the same with anything even Ozempic, sure you could loose weight quickly but the payout for using a shoortcut is being left with saggy skin. And in ICS314 the saggy skin was my understanding of the material I was producing and the content of the course.

## Practical Applications:

## Challenges and Opportunities:

“I am ... cogito ergo sum ... I think, therefore I am.” 

The challenge of AI is when you use it for everything and aren’t responsible for your own learning. I experienced this first hand in my final project when I realized my one of my team mates had soley relied on AI to pass their class and they had no concept of anything software development wise. In their case this lead them unable to do simple tasks because their LLM wiuld halllucinate constantly and they wouldn/'t be able to tell. 

## Comparative Analysis:

## Future Considerations:

“I am ... cogito ergo sum ... I think, therefore I am.” 

## Conclusion:

“I am ... cogito ergo sum ... I think, therefore I am.” 

Anthing can be a great tool when used in the right way. This is simply a universal fact in all disciplines
