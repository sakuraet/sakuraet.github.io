```
    How did you make your effort estimates? Explain your basis and any historical data you used.
    Even though your estimates were often off, did estimating in advance provide any benefit? Provide examples.
    Was tracking actual effort useful? If so, how did it inform future estimates or project decisions?
    How did you track your actual effort (tools, method)? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
    Reflection: what would you change about your estimation or tracking process next time?
    AI use (if applicable): Did you use AI tools for estimating or tracking effort? For each AI tool used, provide:
        Tool name/provider and model/version.
        Exact prompts or representative prompt iterations (redact secrets).
        Time spent on prompt engineering, generation, and verification (break out minutes per bucket).
        What portions of the responses were accepted as-is, and what required manual edits or correction?
```

Initially when I was told to track my effort and estimate it for all assignments in ICS314 I thought the idea was silly. I figured I could either just estimate in my head, or how long I spent wouldn’t matter and I would just work until I was done. That being said, as the semester continued, I realized more and more how useful it was to complete even rough estimations.

## Projecting Time Estimations

Starting off I was mainly shooting my best educated guess based off of assignments that correlated to the issues from class. My estimates were largely based on prior coursework experience with similar frontend and full-stack tasks rather than formal historical data.  However, after milestone 1 or so I had a good basis on how long certain tasks or issues would take as I gathered historical data on my work flow. I would kinda rinse and repeat my estimates for features tat had similar components like I knew that UI-frontend aspects would take about an hour whereas backend and API routing would take much lnger.

Even if my intial estimates were far from the actual time I spent working on the issues, it was still a good mental reminder of the effort I would need to put in for each issue. Like for example, issue-74 which was to find 2 community members to review our application and intervew them I had estimated like 20-30 minutes however it ended up taking more than 45 minutes. But having it jogged down allowed me to make a mental note to set aside time to sit down and talk to these community members instead of pushing it to the side. 


## Tracking Actual Effort

I tracked my effort manually by noting start and stop times for each work session and categorizing the time as coding or non-coding effort. This was done using a combination of a personal notes document and commit timestamps in Git to cross-check activity. It was easy for me to know how long I worked because I use the PomoDoro technique in my life outside of this class anyways to pace myself. However, towards the end where I was mostly just trying to get everything done, the lines between which issue I was working on blurred. For example, on 12/10/25 I recorded working on the WarriorHub application for 10 hours but I was a bit lost on which issues took what amount of time as I was hopping around everywhere trying to get things done.

As for AI I did not use it to track effort or the time estimated. I think an AI would not be able to understand your workflow as well as an indivual could, or at least it shouldn't in my eyes. However, I did use AI in the issues/assignements themselves like ChatGPT was a great help in debugging code or even providing a wireframe mockup of the front-end UI aspects.

## Future Effort Tracking

If I were to repeat this process, I would improve both estimation and tracking by breaking tasks into smaller, more measurable subtasks and recording time at a finer granularity. I think even though the time estimates were a good idea I often got lost in tryig to finish the tasks or improve the website as much as I could rather than sticking to just what my issue covered.

I think the key takeway fro the effort estimation is to pace yourself well. Having a mental note is important n order to organize your time. I believe that exact time estimates aren’t the most important thing to take away from time tracking, but instead the idea of self reflection and not just throwing yourself at a problem is the key idea.
