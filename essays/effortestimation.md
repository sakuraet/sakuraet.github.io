```
    How did you make your effort estimates? Explain your basis and any historical data you used.
    Even though your estimates were often off, did estimating in advance provide any benefit? Provide examples.
    Was tracking actual effort useful? If so, how did it inform future estimates or project decisions?
    How did you track your actual effort (tools, method)? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?
    Reflection: what would you change about your estimation or tracking process next time?
    AI use (if applicable): Did you use AI tools for estimating or tracking effort? For each AI tool used, provide:
        Tool name/provider and model/version.
        Exact prompts or representative prompt iterations (redact secrets).
        Time spent on prompt engineering, generation, and verification (break out minutes per bucket).
        What portions of the responses were accepted as-is, and what required manual edits or correction?
