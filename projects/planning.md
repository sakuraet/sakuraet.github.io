I worked on a team project with the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and Central Pacific Bank to create urban planning schematics for lower-income housing on the UH West Oahu grounds. Our goal was to design practical and affordable housing solutions that balanced financial feasibility with community needs. As part of the team, I contributed to developing the schematics by considering zoning requirements, accessibility, sustainability, and long-term livability. This collaboration gave me the chance to combine technical design with real-world considerations, while also learning from professionals in urban planning and finance.

Alongside creating the schematics, my team and I prepared and presented a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project to investors, industry mentors, and public officials. This required us to clearly communicate the design, financial models, and community benefits in a way that connected technical details with larger social goals. Presenting as a team to such a diverse group of stakeholders taught me how to adapt my communication style, build confidence in professional settings, and see how design, policy, and finance intersect in real urban planning projects.
