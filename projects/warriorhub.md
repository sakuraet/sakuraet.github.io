summary: "WarriorHub: A UH Mānoa Event Scheduler. My ICS 314 final project, it focused on improving scheduling events for the UH community."

## Overview

For my software engineering class, my group and I came up with the idea to create a centralized event discovery platform catered to the students that are attending the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. The goal for this web application was to increase student engagement in on-campus activities by providing a single, easy-to-use platform for discovering and tracking events. Rather than navigating multiple calendars and email notifications, students can view all upcoming events in one place. Every student who creates an account using their hawaii.edu student email can easily view upcoming events, add their ‘interested events’ to their My Events page, view all events on a single Calendar page, and stay up-to-date with all activities and events that are held throughout the semester. Our web application also allows for organizer accounts to create and manage events that will be automatically added to the Search Events page and Calendar page once they are created. Lastly, admin accounts will be able to validate and review all events, as well as all user, organizer, and admin accounts to ensure quality and accuracy. Additional information and source code for this web application project can be found on our WarriorHub GitHub page.

## My Contributions

My primary role on this project was Front-End Developer, with additional responsibilities involving application logic, role-based access, and automated testing using Playwright. I developed the Event Search page, which loaded event data directly from the database and implemented search functionality for users to filter through events by event name, date, organization, and category, which allowed users to efficiently find relevant events that they are interested in attending. For administrative functionality, I created the Admin List Events page and assisted with implementing update and delete features for both administrators and organizers, allowing them to manage their events effectively with a single button and an edit event form page.

In addition to front-end development, I assisted with managing the role-based API access that ensured each page and feature was only accessible to the appropriate user type, such as user, admin, or organizer. I also contributed to the quality of our application by implementing Playwright into the project. This included writing, creating, and fixing automated tests for each user type and all of their respective pages.

## Lessons Learned

In this project, I was able to gain real hands-on experience with a collaborative software development project, such as working within a shared GitHub repository, adhering to coding standards, following design patterns, and respecting ethical choices in software engineering. I definitely learned that front-end and back-end development are not as simple as I had originally thought them to be because my experience with front-end development extended beyond just the visual aspects of the web application and required careful use of backend logic, APIs, and respect for each user role type. Most importantly, I was able to learn the significance of automated testing in maintaining software quality and ensuring that a web application is consistent and works across different web browsers and environments. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of software engineering and development as a collaborative process rather than just writing coding assignments and watching lectures.
